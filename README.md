-----This is the README File-----

To effectively run this code, there is a file with the name 'input.txt'. The start and destination city and country should be inputted there.

The format for the city and country should be:
        <city>, <country> --- for start
        <city>, <country> --- for destination
 
When it comes to running the file, only the main method it to be run.

The contents for both the input file and the output file are empty at this point but data will be written once the steps above are followed.
